LIRI - Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface

The goal of this project is to allow the user to implement command line inputs to recieve data from Spotifiy, Bands in Town, and OMDB API's.

This particular application is useful because it is multifunctional. Through the use of switch statements, users are capable of choosing which API's they would like to use and return new data without refreshing the app. 

Users can get started by determining which function they would like to use. 
Acceptable inputs are as follows:
* node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>
*node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'
*node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'
*node liri.js do-what-it-says


node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>:
